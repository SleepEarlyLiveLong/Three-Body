Among the files above:
- file 'Threebody_4.m' is the source file of this project;
- file 'Threebody_4.fig' is the figure file corresponding with the source file in MATLAB;
- file 'test1.m' and 'test2.m' are files to evaluate the performance of the Three-Body Simulation project.
- file '经典力学框架下的三体运动数值模拟软件.md' is a detailed introduction document for this project. 

There are mainly THREE versions here:
- In v1.0, almost all basic functions are realized, from Sept. 2017 to Oct. 25th 2017;
- In v2.0, a performance evaluation system is added, several variables including energy, momentum and angular momentum are employed to evaluate this simulator quantitatively, costing some days after more than a year of abandonment in the beginning of 2019;
- - In v3.0, the interface of the software is improved.
